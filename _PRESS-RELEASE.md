ShadeTree

Heading

ShadeTree is an app designed to help you keep a log of vehicle maintenances you have performed.

Sub-Heading

This is for diy home mechanics (aka "shade tree" mechanics) to remember details about maintenance task performed on their vehicles.

Summary

Tired of your grease-stained paper notepad? ShadeTree keeps a log of maintenance tasks you have performed on your vehicles, so the next time you have to do the maintenance, you can pull up the log and see exactly what tools are needed and the best resources for that task.

Problem

Performing your own maintenance can be daunting, which makes many of us procrastinate and possibly shorten the lifespan of our vehicles.

Solution

ShadeTree allows you to search your log for the maintenance task your vehicle requires, giving you instant information on when the maintenance was last performed, notes, what tools are needed, and the best online resource for tackling the task.

"I used to ignore my maintenance schedule because I have no time to scour the internet for how-tos everytime. Now I can search up the task in ShadeTree and get the information necessary to quickly get to work." -Arthur Lee (Creator of ShadeTree)

"It's true." -Soon-to-be-fired-or-promoted-spokesperson

How to Get Started

Next time you have to perform a maintenance task, add it to the log and it will be available for viewing in the future.
